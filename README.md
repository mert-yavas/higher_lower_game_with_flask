# Number Guesser with Flask
## Overview
Hello, I'm Mert, and today marks Day 55 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. Welcome to the Number Guesser project. In this project, we've developed a Flask web application that prompts users to guess a random number between 0 and 9.

## Project Description
The application generates a random number between 0 and 9 and displays a webpage where users can input their guesses. Based on the user's guess, the application provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
